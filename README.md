# fmLaPazNow
Display current song playing on lapaz.fm

Since VLC only displays "live" after opening URL[https://icecasthd.net:6192/live]

I decided to build an small application that displays the current song playing on www.lapaz.fm

## MacOS version

![Notification](get_fmLaPaz/now_fmLaPaz.png)

Download get_fmLaPaz as a zip and copy or move to $HOME/Public folder

Run the following command on the Terminal

$ crontab $HOME/Public/get_fmLaPaz/myjob.cron

Done! 
The application will display every 4 minutes in the Notification Center

the current song playing on https://www.lapaz.fm
